# Contributor Guidelines for the `ee` editor

## Build & Testing
- Use the `Makefile`. Run `make clean && make` before committing.

## Coding Style
- Follow the existing C99 style and keep functions small.
- Fix compiler warnings as they appear.

## Development Notes
- Undo/redo work is documented in `Undo.md`. Update this file when a feature starts or finishes.
- Keep short "<feature>.md" note files while implementing new functionality.
